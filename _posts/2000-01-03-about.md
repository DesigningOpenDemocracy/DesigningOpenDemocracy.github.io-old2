# About

This is a group for any tech professionals or political experts (or ordinary citizens) interested in discussing in a detailed way the potential opportunities for reforming existing democratic institutions; from local organisations to national governments around the world through technology or other practices. Our aim is to improve democracy: we think this can best be done by providing a forum for discussing democracy proposals, ideas, and to foster collaboration between people who would like to participate in democracy reform.

Designing Open Democracy will not presume any form of democratic system to be superior, but is a forum for discussion and practical planning on how such system may be implemented. In addition, this meetup will not be exclusive to any political party, but be a forum for members of various parties, groups and individuals to come together to trade ideas related to open democracy and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

This may involve developing criteria and methodologies for evaluating potential implementations (e.g. election softwares or different ways of conducting governance).

*TL;DR: We are an advocacy group for promoting greater interaction between relevant stakeholders involved in developing a more unified and stronger democracy.*
