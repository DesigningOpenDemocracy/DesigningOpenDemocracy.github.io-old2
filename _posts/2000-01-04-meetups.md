# Discussion

## Discourse Web Forum

Our online gathering place is in [discuss.designingopendemocracy.com](https://discuss.designingopendemocracy.com/), where we can discuss in depth various projects and concepts.


## Slack Online Room

For our slack chat channel at [opendemocracy.slack.com](https://opendemocracy.slack.com/). For access, just post a request at our Discourse web forum above.


## Physical Meetups

If you are in Melbourne Australia, you can join us in person via our meetup

[www.meetup.com/DesigningOpenDemocracy](https://www.meetup.com/DesigningOpenDemocracy/)

As mentioned, it is a technical discussion group, so we expect to have detailed discussions about the technical practicalities of different systems and their merits and limitations.

If this sounds like something that's for you, we look forward to seeing you at one of our meetings!


## Contacting Designing Open Democracy team directly

If you have any questions directly related to us that cannot be answered in our web forum then email [contact@designingopendemocracy.com](mailto:contact@designingopendemocracy.com?subject=Website). We are always looking for new venues and interested groups!
