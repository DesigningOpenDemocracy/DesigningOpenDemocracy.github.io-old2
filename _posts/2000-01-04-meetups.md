# Discussion

## Slack Online Room

For our slack channel at [opendemocracy.slack.com](https://opendemocracy.slack.com/)
send us your email via meetup.com and we shall add you in.

## Physical Meetups

If you are in Melbourne Australia, you can join us in person via our meetup

[www.meetup.com/DesigningOpenDemocracy](https://www.meetup.com/DesigningOpenDemocracy/)

Also, if you have any questions or are interested in contributing, please contact us on meetup via the link above or email [nmerange@hotmail.com](mailto:nmerange@hotmail.com?subject=DesigningOpenDemocracy). We are always looking for new venues and interested groups!

As mentioned, it is a technical discussion group, so we expect to have detailed discussions about the technical practicalities of different systems and their merits and limitations.

If this sounds like something that's for you, we look forward to seeing you at one of our meetings!
